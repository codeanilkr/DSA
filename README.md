# DSA
Creating a comprehensive list of all Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems along with their solutions.
However, I can provide you with a general list of popular data structures and algorithms along with resources where you can find problems and solutions:
Data Structures:

    Arrays
    Linked Lists
    Stacks
    Queues
    Trees (Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.)
    Graphs
    Hash Tables
    Heaps
    Tries

Algorithms:

    Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, Linear Search)
    Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
    Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, etc.)
    Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci Series, Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence, etc.)
    Divide and Conquer Algorithms
    Greedy Algorithms
    Backtracking
